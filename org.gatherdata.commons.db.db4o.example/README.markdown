gather-commons :: db4o example
===========================
A simple example of using db4o to persist regular java objects.

Notes
-----
When developing in Eclipse, db4o class dependencies will not get resolved
correctly because some are contained in internal packages. To fix this,
disable Project Properties -> Maven -> "Resolve dependencies from Workspace projects".
